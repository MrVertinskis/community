# Tor Button SCX

This extension adds support for Tor in Sandcat.

##Warning

The proxy support in the latest Sandcat release changed, making this extension partially effective - while Chromium will connect through Tor, Sciter (the UI Engine) will sometimes make direct connections to websites leaking your real IP address.

It is not a Sandcat bug, but a limitation (the proxy support is now available just for the Chromium part).

If this limitation is removed in a future release, we will update this README and possibly add this extension to the official Community extensions.
